## Academic calendar

 - **for full time-students** : lectures take place from Monday to Friday; 
 - **for apprentices** : lectures take place from Monday to Wednesday and Thursdays and Fridays are devoted to the company.

Exceptionally, some lectures can take place with a different schedule than the one described above.
